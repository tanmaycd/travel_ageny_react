##  Project Structure & Approach

The application is structured using modular React components. Hereâ€™s how the solution was approached:

- A mock data file (`tripsData.js`) is used to simulate a dynamic backend API. The UI is populated from this local data source without importing `.json` files directly.
- Components like `Navbar`, `SearchBar`, and reusable `TripCard`s are placed under the `components/` directory for better maintainability.
- Each page has its own sub-folder with its own CSS for **scoped styling**.
- Page transitions, hover effects, and real-time UI updates are handled using React's `useState`, `useEffect`, and CSS transitions.
